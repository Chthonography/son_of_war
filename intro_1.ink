The birds spoke to Tito, sometimes. He heard whispers of conversations in the edges of their chirps, little threats and angry remarks that chased his own thoughts from his head. He suspected they plotted to steal his ideas, his beloved inventions, and so he began to spend less and less time outside. Eventually he bought a cat, and he gleefully watched it as it ambushed and brutally ate the flesh of the birds that landed outside his squalid hamlet. When a monstrous eagle landed outside his window on a gloomy fall evening, he steadied himself by the window and watched, anticipating the victorious murder of the parasite that trespassed in his domain. As the cat approached the eagle, however, a monstrous talon seized it by the throat.
