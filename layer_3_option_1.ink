In a few hours, Tito had received eight offers from his fellow internet dwellers. He had a feeling any more than four would cause more problems than it might solve, so he decided that to narrow it down he would look at them in pairs of two and choose one from each pair to accompany him. The first offer came from Ivor, a Scottish man who claimed he could scale a hundred-foot cliffside in two minutes. The second offer came from Tyrone, who warned Tito that he was allergic to cats. Tito could find no skills that could be helpful in rescuing a cat from an eagle listed in Tyrone's offer, but had a good feeling about him anyway. In the end, Tito decided to choose...

+ Ivor.
