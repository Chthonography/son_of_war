Tito visited the nearest animal shelter, bought a new cat, and named him Jorge. Tito returned home with his new cat and scoffed at the birds on his way to the front door. "Defend me from the birds!" shouted Tito to Jorge triumphantly. Jorge, however, was not interested in ambushing and consuming birds, and he spent most of his days napping on Tito's windowsill. Tito could hear the birds chirping their incessant remarks. Jorge had failed him. He needed a new plan. After much deliberation, Tito decided the only way to guarantee his protection from the birds was to protect his home with panthers. The easiest way to obtain panthers would be to steal them from the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska, so at midnight Tito hijacked a commercial jet from the Mason City Airport and flew it to the panthers' exhibit. As he loaded up the plane with panthers, he counted that there were thirteen of them. Tito flew the plane back to his home. Before landing, he noticed that his house was surrounded by police cars. Somehow he had not gone unseen as he had hoped. Tito refused to be met by the cops, so he flipped a u-ie and flew the plane to the Sahara Desert. As he neared the desert, he heard - sirens? Impossible. Tito veered left to get a good look behind him and found two black and blue airplanes with police sirens on them following him. Tito's anxiety grew as he wondered how they had possibly traced him all the way from Iowa. He had to form a plan.
